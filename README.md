# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

**This is ALX Pro-Dev Frontend development Task**

# What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It serves as the blueprint for what the system must achieve and guides all future stages of development, including design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

**Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

Requirement Analysis is critical because it ensures that:

 The development team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the software goals.

 Developers build the right product, not just build the product right.

 Potential issues, ambiguities, and risks are identified early, reducing costly changes later in the project.

 Functional and non-functional requirements (like performance, security, and usability) are clearly defined.

 **Key Activities in Requirement Analysis**

Requirement Elicitation
Gathering information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observation, etc.

Requirement Specification
Documenting the requirements in a clear, consistent, and unambiguous manner (e.g., in a Software Requirements Specification â€“ SRS).

Requirement Validation
Ensuring the documented requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs.

Requirement Management
Handling changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
